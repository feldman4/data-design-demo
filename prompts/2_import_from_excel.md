1. Please write a function that uses pandas to import the contents of image_data.csv and conditions.csv into the database. Check that all plate/well combinations described in conditions.csv are present in image_data.csv. Include a separate test function that uses mock data to demonstrate correctness.

2. Please write a function that generates a mock image_data.csv and conditions.csv for an experiment involving adding different compounds inhibiting cell growth to either Hep2G or A549 cells. The cells were tested on different plates. The channels imaged at each position were: DAPI, GFP, mitotracker

3. Please write a python function that gets the names of all functions defined in the current module (but not ones imported from other modules). Use it to create a python fire CLI for all functions defined in the current module.

4. Please write a function that summarizes the contents of the database. Print useful stats such as the number of plates, wells, and so on to the command line.

5. Write a function that visualizes the experimental conditions tested across the plates in the database. Display the plates as 2D grids, with rows A-H and columns 1-12. The function should take two arguments: the database name, and a directory to save the results as png images.
